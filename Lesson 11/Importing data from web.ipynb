    "\n",
    "A lot of data aren't accessible through data sets or APIs. They may exist on the Internet as Web pages, though. One way to access the data without waiting for the provider to create an API is to use a technique called **Web scraping**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping allows us to load a Web page into Python and extract the information we want. We can then work with the data using standard analysis tools like <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">pandas</span> and <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">numpy</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can do Web scraping, we need to understand the structure of the Web page we're working with, then find a way to extract parts of that structure in a sensible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">requests</span> library heavily as we learn about Web scraping. This library enables us to download a Web page. We'll also use the <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">beautifulsoup</span> library to extract the relevant parts of the Web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Web Page Structure\n",
    "==\n",
    "\n",
    "Web pages use HyperText Markup Language (HTML). HTML isn't a programming language like Python. It's a markup language with its own syntax and rules. When a Web browser like Chrome or Firefox downloads a Web page, it reads the HTML to determine how to render it and display it to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the HTML for a very simple Web page:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <head>\n",
    "        <title>A simple example page</title>\n",
    "    </head>\n",
    "    <body>\n",
    "        <p>Here is some simple content for this page.</p>\n",
    "    </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see what this page looks like on our [GitHub site](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ivanovitchm/EEC2006/blob/master/Lesson%2011/html/simple.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML consists of tags. We open a tag like this:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```html\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We close a tag like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">```html\n",
    "<\\p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Anything in between the opening and closing of a tag is the content of that tag. We can nest tags to create complex formatting rules. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```html\n",
    "<p><b>Hello, this is a bold paragraph<\\b><\\p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">b</span> tag bolds the content inside it, and the <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">p</span> tag creates a new paragraph. The HTML above will display as a bold paragraph because the <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">b</span> tag is inside the <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">p</span> tag. In other words, the <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">b</span> tag is nested within the <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">p</span> tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML documents contain a few major sections. The <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">head</span> section contains information that's useful to the Web browser that's rendering the page; the user doesn't see it. The <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">body</span> section contains the bulk of the content the user interacts with on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different tags have different purposes. For example, the title tag tells the Web browser what page <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">title</span> to display at the top of your tab. The <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">p</span> tag indicates that the content inside it is a single paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't cover tags comprehensively here, but please read the [Mozilla Developer Network's (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) article on HTML basics if you need more of a grounding on this topic. Check out [MDN's guide to the HTML element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) for a list of all possible HTML tags. In order to do Web scraping effectively, you'll need a solid understanding of the various tags and how they work.\n",

You may have noticed that our simple HTML pages from the past few screens didn't have any styling; all of the paragraphs had black text and the same font size. Most Web pages use CSS to display a lot more than basic black text.\n",
