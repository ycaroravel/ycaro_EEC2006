K-fold cross validation, on the other hand, takes advantage of a larger proportion of the data during training while still rotating through different subsets of the data to avoid the issues of train/test validation.\n",

    "8. Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "==\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've been working under the assumption that a lower RMSE always means that a model is more accurate. This isn't the complete picture, unfortunately. A model has two sources of error, **bias** and **variance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias describes error that results in bad assumptions about the learning algorithm. For example, assuming that only one feature, like a car's weight, relates to a car's fuel efficiency will lead you to fit a simple, univariate regression model that will result in high bias. The error rate will be high since a car's fuel efficiency is affected by many other factors besides just its weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance describes error that occurs because of the variability of a model's predicted values. If we were given a dataset with 1000 features on each car and used every single feature to train an incredibly complicated multivariate regression model, we will have low bias but high variance. In an ideal world, we want low bias and low variance but in reality, there's always a tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation of the RMSE values can be a proxy for a model's **variance** while the average RMSE is a proxy for a model's **bias**. Bias and variance are the 2 observable sources of error in a model that we can indirectly control.\n",

    "While k-nearest negihbors can make predictions, it isn't a mathematical model. A mathematical model is usually an equation that can exist without the original data, which isn't true with k-nearest neighbors. In the next classes, we'll learn about a mathematical model called linear regression. We'll explore the bias-variance tradeoff in greater depth in these next 2 courses because of its importance when working with mathematical models in particular.\n"
