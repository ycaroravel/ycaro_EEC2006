    "## 1. Introduction to Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we are going to be introducing the concepts behind classes and objects. In your path to becoming proficient in Python, you have been introduced to classes and objects everywhere without knowing it. Python is known as an **object-oriented programming** language which means that everything in Python is an object! This means that integers, floats, strings, and anything else you can imagine is an object which is created from a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anytime you assign an integer, string, or another type to a variable you have been creating an object from their respective classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    "count = 8\n",
    "foo = \"bar\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"300\" alt=\"creating a repo\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0BxhVm1REqwr0azRoY2hrOUt6b3M\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a class as the blueprint used to construct objects with. These **blueprints** share similar functions (called **methods**) that we can use with any object. For example, when we create a list object, every list will have the <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">append</span> method defined by the list class.\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list.append(4)\n",
    "# my_list object uses the append method which is defined by the list class.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A class bundles up logically grouped functions and variables (called **attributes**) that we can use anywhere in our code. The reason to use classes is similar to modules but instead of a requiring multiple files for different groupings, we can add multiple classes to a single file. This promotes code abstraction which helps us by not having to repeatedly write the same code over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the previous mission that we used the <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">csv module</span> to parse a csv file. As you may remember, all we can do with those csv files is read from a file and then load it in a list. Unfortunately, within the <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">csv module</span>, there are no helpful functions to do some actual analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional functionality would have to be written on our own. One way is to write a function that can take in the csv data as a parameter and then run some analysis. But then where do we keep this function? What if we want to run multiple functions on the same dataset? Using a class, we can bundle up the csv data with common methods and share it across our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this mission, we'll be working on creating a dataset object that can take in any csv file and expose methods to query it. The example data set we will be working with is a list of National Football League (NFL) games. Here are the first three rows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Year | Week | Winner              | Loser               |\n",

    "| 2009 | 1    | New York Giants     | Washington Redskins |\n",

    "## 2. Defining the dataset class\n",

    "To create a class in Python, we use the keyword <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">class</span> followed by the desired class name. The class name, by convention, is in <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">PascalCase</span> where the first letter of every word is capitalized. Here is how you would define the dataset class:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's break this down piece by piece. Within the declaration of the <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">class</span> we have written what looks like the function syntax for the method <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">\\_\\_init\\_\\_()</span>. Remember from before that internal functions of a class are called methods. Before we explain what <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">\\_\\_init\\_\\_()</span> does, let's see the syntax on how to create a dataset object.\n",

    "\n",
    "This <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">new_dataset</span> variable refers to an instance of the Dataset class. When creating this object, the Python interpreter uses the special <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">__\\_init\\_\\_()</span> method we defined to instantiate the object. This creates the new object and then sets those attributes to the instance.\n",

    "\n",

    "Let's take a look back at where we defined the <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">\\_\\_init\\_\\_()</span> method. You can see that we had to pass in an argument to the <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">\\_\\_init\\_\\_()</span> method, self.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses this <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">self</span> variable to refer to the created object so you can interact with the instance data. If you didn't have <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">self</span>, then the class wouldn't know where to store the internal data you wanted to keep. By convention, <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">self</span> is used to define the instance even though it's possible to name it whatever you want. It is highly recommended to use <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">self</span> because any project that is built using Python will also give it that name.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating an object, you never have to worry about passing in a <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">self</span> object on instantiation since this is done automatically by the Python interpreter.

Multiple screens ago, we wrote a print_data method that took in a number of rows and then printed out those rows. Now, we are going to write another method that will do something similar but using a python special function instead.\n",

Each one of provides additional customization that the python interpreter will use to enhance your object. When we implemented <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">\\_\\_init\\_\\_()</span>, it told the python interpreter that anything within that method is what we want to initialize when we create our object.\n",
