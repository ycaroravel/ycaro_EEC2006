    "Data science involves processing, analyzing, and visualizing data. While some tools like Microsoft Excel allow us to perform basic data science tasks, they're limited to the functionality built in to the user interface. If you want to work with datasets that aren't structured like a spreadsheet or create entire new data visualizations from scratch, you'll need to become proficient in **programming**. Instead of using a program written by others that can solve a narrow set of tasks, you can create your own programs that can solve your specific problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming involves organizing a collection of instructions into a program for a computer to carry out. To express these instructions, we use a **programming language**. In this track, we focus on a language called Python. **Python** is a general-purpose programming language that is becoming more and more popular for doing **data science**. Companies worldwide are using Python to harvest insights from their data and get a competitive edge.\n",

Often in data science, we're working with thousands of data points that are grouped together in a certain way and have an order to them. We need a container that can hold multiple values that we can use to perform operations on. We can use a **list**, which is an object that represents a sequence of values. For example, we can represent the cities in our dataset as a list as a sequence of strings (<span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">\"Natal\"</span>, <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">\"SÃ£o Paulo\"</span>, and so on).\n",

    "## 7. If Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to work with Boolean values, let's dive more into how we use Booleans to express conditional logic. To complement Booleans, Python contains the if operator. We can use this operator to write a statement that tests whether certain conditions exist. Our if statement will evaluate to either <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">True</span> or <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">False</span>, and only run the specified code when <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">True</span>.\n",

    ">```python\n",
    "sample_rate = 749\n",
    "greater = (sample_rate > 5)\n",
    "if greater:                    #This is the conditional statement.\n",
    "    print(sample_rate)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can nest if statements to specify multiple criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    "value = 1500\n",
    "if value > 500:\n",
    "    if value > 1000:\n",
    "        print(\"This number is HUGE!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also nest if statements within for loops, and vice versa. For example, we can search a list for the existence of a specific value by combining a for loop with an if statement. The if statement determines whether the current element is equivalent to the value we're interested in:\n",
